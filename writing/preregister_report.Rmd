Replication of the anchor effect

Inga Kramarek and Sarah Kusch

    3. Research Questions 
        3.1. Please list each research question included in this study.


Our first hypothesis is directional and we hypothesize that those participants who receive a low anchor make a significantly lower absolute estimate compared to those who receive a high anchor irrespective of the question's content.

Our second hypothesis is non-directional and says that there is no significant difference in estimates between participants who know about the anchor effect and those who don't.

# Sampling Plan



# Variables

  1. Manipulated variables
  
    The manipulated variable, hereafter "anchor variable", can take the values 'high' or 'low' and indicates whether the question contained a low or a high anchor. Each participant will receive six questions with a low and six with a high anchor. 
    
  2. Measured variables
  
    We will measure the absolute estimation the participants give for each of the 12 questions. As well as whether the participants know about the anchor effect or not, hereafter "knowledge variable".

  3. Indices
  
    We will z-transform all estimates per question to eliminate the varying units. Then we will avarage across all z-transformed estimates per anchor condition and per participant to determine the participant's mean estimate for the low and high anchor condition respectively. This will yield two mean z-scores per participant per condition.
    
  
# Design Plan


# Analysis Plan

For the first hypothesis we will use a paired t-test with the outcome (dependent variable) being the z-transformed estimates per participant and per anchor condition. The predictor (independent variable) is the anchor variable.

The second hypothesis will be tested using a linear mixed model with random intercept per participant and per question. The predictors are the anchor variable and additionally the kowledge variable. The outcome (dependent variable) will be the z-transformed estimates per participant and per anchor condition. We are going to analyse the main effect of the knowledge variable.

We will z-transform the given estimates as indicated under "Variables" "3. Indices". We will not do any follow-up analyses.

For our analysis we will use  $\alpha = 0.05$ as an inference criterion. Both hypothesis will be tested one-tailed. 

We will exclude outlier and impossible answers since our main statistical measurement is the mean and sensitive to outiers.
